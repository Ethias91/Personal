This is a simple tax calculator which requires the state tax rate in a percentage format (0.00%).
It includes the tax cost and total with said tax cost included. 
the equation is pretty simple. It asks what the cost of the item is and what the tax rate is. Then, it takes the tax rate entered, divides it by 100 then multiplies the total
by that number. 
Pretty straightforward. I've tested multiple times to confirm the math works correctly. 

It originally would only calculate the tax rate of Texas where I reside but I decided to change that in case anyone for whatever reason, would use this.
